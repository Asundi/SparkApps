## Spark MLLib Documentation

* Spark MLLib is library from Spark Project. It is an Ecosystem project under Spark.
* MLLib makes practical machine learning is easy at scale.
* MLLib is collection of Machine learning algorithms, feature engineering, tools and utilities.
* MLLib is avialable in two ways:
  * RDD based (Older One) - spark.mllib
  * DataFrame based (New one) - spark.ml
* MLLib offers the following things:
  * ML Algorithms: common learning algorithms such as classification, regression, clustering, and collaborative filtering
  * Featurization: feature extraction, transformation, dimensionality reduction, and selection
  * Pipelines: tools for constructing, evaluating, and tuning ML Pipelines
  * Persistence: saving and load algorithms, models, and Pipelines
  * Utilities: linear algebra, statistics, data handling, etc.
